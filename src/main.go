	// Create a world where a small number of agents make choices,
	// some determined by random numbers from random.org.
	// This simulates a cosmos.
	// Let the simulation be stepwise advanced by the user.
	// The user has all knowledge of the cosmos
	// and can predict some of what will happen
	// by observing probable results of the random decision points.
	// However, the user does not know for certain
	// Everything about what choices will be made
	// By the agents,
	// as that knowledge does not yet exist.
	// Hence can a logically omnicient Being have things
	// which are not known to them,
	// because they are not logically possible to know;
	// or,
	// more specifically,
	// because said Being created a cosmos
	// (although he could have chosen not to)
	// in which there were choices
	// whose outcome could not--
	// or more properly,
	// chose not to change the cosmological properties to allow to--
	// be determined
	// before their resolution.
